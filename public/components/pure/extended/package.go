// Package extended contains component implementations that have a larger
// dependency footprint but do not interact with external systems (so an
// extension of pure components)

// EXPERIMENTAL: The specific components excluded by this package may change
// outside of major version releases. This means we may choose to remove certain
// plugins if we determine that their dependencies are likely to interfere with
// the goals of this package.
