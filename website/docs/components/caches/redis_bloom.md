Bloom filters are a probabilistic data structure that checks for presence of an element in a set.

A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure in Redis Stack that enables you to check if an element is present in a set using a very small memory space of a fixed size.

Instead of storing all of the elements in the set, Bloom Filters store only the elements' hashed representation, thus sacrificing some precision. The trade-off is that Bloom Filters are very space-efficient and fast.

A Bloom filter can guarantee the absence of an element from a set, but it can only give an estimation about its presence. So when it responds that an element is not present in a set (a negative answer), you can be sure that indeed is the case. But one out of every N positive answers will be wrong. Even though it looks unusual at a first glance, this kind of uncertainty still has its place in computer science. There are many cases out there where a negative answer will prevent more costly operations, for example checking if a username has been taken, if a credit card has been reported as stolen, if a user has already seen an ad and much more.

See more [here](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/probabilistic/bloom-filter/).

## Fields

### `url`

The URL of the target Redis server. Database is optional and is supplied as the URL path.


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

url: redis://:6397

url: redis://localhost:6379

url: redis://:foopassword@redisplace:6379

url: redis://localhost:6379/1

url: redis://localhost:6379/1,redis://localhost:6380/1
```

### `kind`

Specifies a simple, cluster-aware, or failover-aware redis client.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"simple"`  
Options: `simple`, `cluster`, `failover`.

### `master`

Name of the redis master when `kind` is `failover`


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

master: mymaster
```

### `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.

**Troubleshooting**

Some cloud hosted instances of Redis (such as Azure Cache) might need some hand holding in order to establish stable connections. Unfortunately, it is often the case that TLS issues will manifest as generic error messages such as "i/o timeout". If you're using TLS and are seeing connectivity problems consider setting `enable_renegotiation` to `true`, and ensuring that the server supports at least TLS version 1.2.


Type: `object`  

### `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer  

### `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

### `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

### `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format. Warning: Since it does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

password: foo

password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
```

### `filter_key`

Specify the key used by the probabilistic bloom filter. 

If the key does not exists, we will create one using the default capacity.


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

filter_key: bf:benthos

filter_key: cache:bf:benthos

filter_key: bloom-filer:benthos:20230919

filter_key: dedupe:bf:benthos:1694774600

filter_key: anything-descriptive
```

### `strict`

if `true`, bloom filter will fail on delete operations


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `insert_options`

If specified, will be used on Add/Set operations

See [BF.INSERT](https://redis.io/commands/bf.insert/)


Type: `object`  

### `insert_options.capacity`

Specifies the desired capacity for the filter to be created.
This parameter is ignored if the filter already exists. 
If the filter is automatically created and this parameter is absent, then the module-level capacity is used. 
See [BF.RESERVE](https://redis.io/commands/bf.reserve) for more information about the impact of this value.


Type: `int`  
Default: `1024`  

### `insert_options.error_rate`

Specifies the error ratio of the newly created filter if it does not yet exist.
				
The rate is a decimal value between 0 and 1. For example, for a desired false positive rate of 0.1% (1 in 1000), error_rate should be set to 0.001.

If the filter is automatically created and error is not specified then the module-level error rate is used.
See [BF.RESERVE](https://redis.io/commands/bf.reserve) for more information about the impact of this value.


Type: `float`  
Default: `0.001`  

### `insert_options.expansion`

When capacity is reached, an additional sub-filter is created. 
The size of the new sub-filter is the size of the last sub-filter multiplied by expansion, specified as a positive integer.

If the number of elements to be stored in the filter is unknown, use an expansion of 2 or more to reduce the number of sub-filters. 
Otherwise, use an expansion of 1 to reduce memory consumption. The default value is 2.


Type: `int`  
Default: `2`  

### `insert_options.non_scaling`

Prevents the filter from creating additional sub-filters if initial capacity is reached.
Non-scaling filters require slightly less memory than their scaling counterparts. 
The filter returns an error when capacity is reached.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `insert_options.no_create`

Indicates that the filter should not be created if it does not already exist. 
If the filter does not yet exist, an error is returned rather than creating it automatically. 
This may be used where a strict separation between filter creation and filter addition is desired. 
It is an error to specify NOCREATE together with either CAPACITY or ERROR.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `retries`

Determine time intervals and cut offs for retry attempts.


Type: `object`  

### `retries.initial_interval`

The initial period to wait between retry attempts.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"500ms"`  

```yml
# Examples

initial_interval: 50ms

initial_interval: 1s
```

### `retries.max_interval`

The maximum period to wait between retry attempts


Type: `string`  
Default: `"1s"`  

```yml
# Examples

max_interval: 5s

max_interval: 1m
```

### `retries.max_elapsed_time`

The maximum overall period of time to spend on retry attempts before the request is aborted.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"5s"`  

```yml
# Examples

max_elapsed_time: 1m

max_elapsed_time: 1h
```

This component implements all cache operations, however it does not store any value, only the keys.

The main intent is to be used on deduplication.
			
When fetch a key from this case, if the key exists, we return a fixed string`t`.
