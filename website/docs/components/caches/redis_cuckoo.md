:::caution BETA
This component is mostly stable but breaking changes could still be made outside of major version releases if a fundamental problem with the component is found.
:::
Use a Redis instance as a probabilistic cache using cuckoo filters.

Cuckoo filters are a probabilistic data structure that checks for presence of an element in a set.

A Cuckoo filter, just like a Bloom filter, is a probabilistic data structure in Redis Stack that enables you to check if an element is present in a set in a very fast and space efficient way, while also allowing for deletions and showing better performance than Bloom in some scenarios.

While the Bloom filter is a bit array with flipped bits at positions decided by the hash function, a Cuckoo filter is an array of buckets, storing fingerprints of the values in one of the buckets at positions decided by the two hash functions. A membership query for item x searches the possible buckets for the fingerprint of x, and returns true if an identical fingerprint is found. A cuckoo filter's fingerprint size will directly determine the false positive rate.

## Fields

### `url`

The URL of the target Redis server. Database is optional and is supplied as the URL path.


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

url: redis://:6397

url: redis://localhost:6379

url: redis://:foopassword@redisplace:6379

url: redis://localhost:6379/1

url: redis://localhost:6379/1,redis://localhost:6380/1
```

### `kind`

Specifies a simple, cluster-aware, or failover-aware redis client.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"simple"`  
Options: `simple`, `cluster`, `failover`.

### `master`

Name of the redis master when `kind` is `failover`


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

master: mymaster
```

### `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.

**Troubleshooting**

Some cloud hosted instances of Redis (such as Azure Cache) might need some hand holding in order to establish stable connections. Unfortunately, it is often the case that TLS issues will manifest as generic error messages such as "i/o timeout". If you're using TLS and are seeing connectivity problems consider setting `enable_renegotiation` to `true`, and ensuring that the server supports at least TLS version 1.2.


Type: `object`  

### `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  

### `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`  
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer  

### `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

### `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

### `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format. Warning: Since it does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.
:::warning Secret
This field contains sensitive information that usually shouldn't be added to a config directly, read our [secrets page for more info](/docs/configuration/secrets).
:::


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

```yml
# Examples

password: foo

password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
```

### `filter_key`

Specify the key used by the probabilistic cuckoo filter. 

If the key does not exists, we will create one using the default capacity.


Type: `string`  

```yml
# Examples

filter_key: cf:benthos

filter_key: cache:cf:benthos

filter_key: cuckoo-filter:benthos:20230919

filter_key: dedupe:cf:benthos:1694774600

filter_key: anything-descriptive
```

### `retries`

Determine time intervals and cut offs for retry attempts.


Type: `object`  

### `retries.initial_interval`

The initial period to wait between retry attempts.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"500ms"`  

```yml
# Examples

initial_interval: 50ms

initial_interval: 1s
```

### `retries.max_interval`

The maximum period to wait between retry attempts


Type: `string`  
Default: `"1s"`  

```yml
# Examples

max_interval: 5s

max_interval: 1m
```

### `retries.max_elapsed_time`

The maximum overall period of time to spend on retry attempts before the request is aborted.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"5s"`  

```yml
# Examples

max_elapsed_time: 1m

max_elapsed_time: 1h
```

This component implements all cache operations, however it does not store any value, only the keys.

			The main intent is to be used on deduplication.
			
			When fetch a key from this case, if the key exists, we return a fixed string`t`.
