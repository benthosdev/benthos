Stores keys in a cuckoo in-memory filter, useful for deduplication. This cache is therefore reset every time the service restarts.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
label: ""
cuckoo:
  cap: 10000
  init_values: []
```

This provides the cuckoo package which implements a fixed-size thread safe Cuckoo filter.

It uses the package [`cuckoofilter`](github.com/seiflotfy/cuckoofilter)

The field init_values can be used to pre-populate the memory cache with any number of keys:

```yml
cache_resources:
  - label: foocache
    cuckoo:
      cap: 1024
      init_values:
        - foo
        - bar
```

These values can be overridden during execution.

## Fields

### `cap`

The cache maximum capacity (number of entries)


Type: `int`  
Default: `10000`  

### `init_values`

A table of keys that should be present in the cache on initialization. This can be used to create static lookup tables.


Type: `array`  
Default: `[]`  

```yml
# Examples

init_values:
  - Nickelback
  - Spice Girls
  - The Human League
```

This component implements all cache operations, however it does not store any value, only the keys.

The main intent is to be used on deduplication.

When fetch a key from this case, if the key exists, we return a fixed string`t`.
