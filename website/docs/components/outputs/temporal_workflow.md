## Fields

### `host`

The temporal server host.


Type: `string`  

### `port`

The temporal server port.


Type: `int`  

### `namespace`

The namespace name for this client to work with.


Type: `string`  

### `identity`

Sets an identify that can be used to track this host for debugging.


Type: `string`  

### `name`

The name of the workflow to execute.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  

### `task_queue`

The queue where the workflow will be scheduled.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  

### `args_mapping`

A mapping that is used to get the arguments for the workflow execution.


Type: `string`  

### `await_result`

Determines if the output will wait for a result from the workflow execution.


Type: `string`  
Default: `"final_run"`  

| Option | Summary |
|---|---|
| `current_run` | Only wait for current workflow execution run to complete. Any subsequent runs, due to continue-as-new or retries, are ignored. |
| `final_run` | Wait for the latest workflow execution run to complete. The output will block until retries/failures are resolved or continue-as-new runs return. |
| `skip` | Do not wait for any workflow runs and return immediately after successfully starting a workflow execution. |


### `id`

The business identifier of the workflow execution.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  

### `id_reuse_policy`

Whether server allow reuse of workflow ID, can be useful for dedupe logic if set to RejectDuplicate.


Type: `string`  
Options: `allow_duplicate`, `allow_duplicate_failed_only`, `reject_duplicate`, `terminate_if_running`.

### `memo`

Optional non-indexed info that will be shown in list workflow.


Type: `string`  

### `search_attributes`

Optional indexed info that can be used in query of List/Scan/Count workflow APIs.


Type: `string`  

### `execution_timeout`

The timeout for duration of workflow execution. It includes retries and continue as new. Use WorkflowRunTimeout to limit execution time of a single workflow run.


Type: `string`  

### `run_timeout`

The timeout for duration of a single workflow run.


Type: `string`  

### `task_timeout`

The timeout for processing workflow task from the time the worker pulled this task. If a workflow task is lost, it is retried after this timeout.


Type: `string`  

### `retry_policy`

Optional retry policy for workflow.


Type: `object`  

### `retry_policy.initial_interval`

Backoff interval for the first retry.If BackoffCoefficient is 1.0 then it is used for all retries. If not set or set to 0, a default interval of 1s will be used.


Type: `string`  

### `retry_policy.backoff_coefficient`

Coefficient used to calculate the next retry backoff interval.


Type: `float`  

### `retry_policy.maximum_interval`

Maximum backoff interval between retries. Exponential backoff leads to interval increase. This value is the cap of the interval. Default is 100x of initial interval.


Type: `string`  

### `retry_policy.maximum_attempts`

Maximum number of attempts. When exceeded the retries stop even if not expired yet. If not set or set to 0, it means unlimited, and rely on activity ScheduleToCloseTimeout to stop.


Type: `int`  

### `retry_policy.non_retryable_error_types`

Non-Retriable errors. Temporal server will stop retry if error type matches this list. Note that cancellation is not a failure, so it won't be retried and only StartToClose or Heartbeat timeouts are retryable.


Type: `array`  

### `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of workflow execution requests that can be made in parallel.


Type: `int`  
Default: `64`
