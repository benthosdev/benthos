:::
Evaluate and transform JSON or CUE messages using a CUE module.

Introduced in version 4.2.0.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
label: ""
cue_eval:
  dir: ""
  package: ""
  fill_path: ""
  selector: ""
```

The evaluation of messages is performed in the scope of a package within a CUE module - or more accurately an [instance](https://cuelang.org/docs/concepts/packages/#instances) of a package. Messages can be either JSON or CUE encoded since CUE is a superset of JSON.


## Fields

### `dir`

The directory that contains the CUE module. This directory should contain the `cue.mod` subdirectory. An empty value means it will run in the current directory.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `package`

Selects the package to load within the CUE module. If this is not set, then there should be only one package in the build context.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`  

### `fill_path`

The path within the CUE instance to unify with the incoming message. This field supports interpolation.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`  

### `selector`

A selector expression that is used to pluck a particular field's value after a CUE evaluation. This field supports interpolation.
This field supports [interpolation functions](/docs/configuration/interpolation#bloblang-queries).


Type: `string`
